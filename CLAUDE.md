# CLAUDE.md - UltraCoach Project Guide

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the UltraCoach project. It ensures consistency, context, and proper workflow across all development sessions.

## 🔄 Session Workflow (IMPORTANT)

**At the start of EVERY new conversation:**

1. **Read PLANNING.md** to understand project vision, architecture, and technical context
2. **Check TASKS.md** to see current milestone, pending tasks, and priorities
3. **Review this file** for project-specific guidance and context
4. **Mark completed tasks** in TASKS.md immediately upon completion. After commits, move complete tasks to `COMPLETED_TASKS.md`
5. **Add newly discovered tasks** to TASKS.md when found during development
6. Always use tslog library and utilities for logging (no console.log)

### MCP Instructions

- When fetching data from Context7 MCP - add to the `.context7-docs` directory (gitignored). Create a new directory for the library if one does not exist. Before fetching from Context7 refer to `.context7-docs` to see if data and/or snippets have already been added

## 🗄️ Database Connection (IMPORTANT)

**Always use the proper database scripts - NEVER try to connect directly as local user!**

### Correct Database Commands:

```bash
# Connect to database
pnpm db:connect

# Run a query
pnpm db:query "SELECT * FROM coach_runners LIMIT 5;"

# Drizzle operations
pnpm db:generate    # Generate migrations
pnpm db:push        # Push schema changes (uses --force)
pnpm db:migrate     # Apply migrations
pnpm db:studio      # Open Drizzle Studio

# Database seeding and setup
pnpm db:seed        # Seed database with test data
pnpm db:fresh       # Reset and seed database
```

### Database Philosophy:

- **Use Drizzle for ALL database operations** (migrations, queries, schema changes)
- Environment variables are properly loaded from `.env.local` for local dev
- Scripts handle Supabase connection string correctly
- NEVER use direct psql commands without proper environment loading

## 📊 Project Overview

UltraCoach is a professional ultramarathon coaching platform built with Next.js 15, Supabase, BetterAuth, and Jotai state management. The platform supports race-centric training plans, proper periodization, coach-runner relationships, and real-time communication.

### Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-05)

- **Current Focus**: Advanced Jotai state management patterns implementation - Phase 2 complete ✅
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, Better Auth, Drizzle ORM, HeroUI, Advanced Jotai state management with performance optimizations
- **Developer Experience**: Pre-commit hooks prevent failed builds, automated TypeScript/ESLint validation, zero compilation errors, zero ESLint warnings, professional toast notifications
- **Database**: Comprehensive relationship system with proper constraints, type safety, production-ready with comprehensive test data (18 users, 3 relationships, 15 workouts)
- **State Management**: Advanced Jotai patterns implemented - atomFamily, loadable, unwrap, splitAtom for granular performance
- **Performance**: Granular component re-rendering using splitAtom pattern for messages and workouts
- **Next Phase**: Fix messages system bugs, redesign workouts UI, or Phase 3 advanced state management (action atoms, serialization)

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology

### Core Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript
- **UI Library**: HeroUI (React components with Tailwind CSS integration)
- **Design System**: Mountain Peak Enhanced - Alpine aesthetic with professional UX
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS-first configuration + HeroUI theme system + Custom Mountain Peak colors
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons for enhanced visual design
- **State**: Advanced Jotai atomic state management with performance optimizations (atomFamily, loadable, unwrap, splitAtom patterns)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with enhanced training schema
- **Auth**: Better Auth (migrated from NextAuth.js for improved stability)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (better performance than npm)
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for better request handling and error management
- **Code Quality**: Husky v10 pre-commit hooks with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier validation
- **Pre-commit Automation**: Automated quality checks prevent failed builds and maintain code standards
- **React Suspense**: Modern async data loading with enhanced error boundaries and loading states
- **Loading Components**: Comprehensive skeleton components for consistent UX across all data loading

## 📝 Recent Project Notes

- **Advanced Jotai State Management (2025-08-05)**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Phase 1 & 2 complete
  - **Phase 1**: atomFamily, loadable, unwrap patterns for async data handling
  - **Phase 2**: splitAtom performance optimizations with granular component re-rendering
  - **Granular Components**: GranularMessage, PerformantMessageList, GranularWorkoutCard, PerformantWorkoutsList
  - **Performance**: Each message/workout now has individual atom for minimal re-renders
- **Technical Infrastructure**: Complete Drizzle migration system, Better Auth session handling, comprehensive logging, type-safe operations
- **Code Quality**: Zero TypeScript errors, zero ESLint warnings, production-ready codebase
- **Next Priorities**: Fix messages system bugs (flickering, contact selection), redesign workouts UI layout, or implement Phase 3 advanced patterns

## 🚨 TypeScript Code Quality Standards (CRITICAL)

**NEVER use `any` type - this is strictly forbidden**

Instead, always:

1. Define proper types and interfaces for all data structures
2. Use specific union types (e.g., `'runner' | 'coach'`) instead of string
3. Use `unknown` for truly unknown data, then type guard/validate it
4. Create reusable type definitions at the top of test files
5. Prefer type safety over convenience - proper types prevent bugs

Example of CORRECT typing:

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Define proper types
type UserRole = 'runner' | 'coach'
type SessionUser = { id: string; email: string; role?: UserRole }
type SessionData = { user?: SessionUser }

// ✅ GOOD - Use proper types
const userRole: UserRole = sessionData?.user?.role || 'runner'
```

Example of INCORRECT typing:

```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Never use any
const sessionData: any = { user: { role: 'coach' } }
const userRole = (sessionData.user as any).role || 'runner'
```
