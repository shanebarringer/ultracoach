# CLAUDE.md - UltraCoach Project Guide

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the UltraCoach project. It ensures consistency, context, and proper workflow across all development sessions.

## üîÑ Session Workflow (IMPORTANT)

**At the start of EVERY new conversation:**
1. **Read PLANNING.md** to understand project vision, architecture, and technical context
2. **Check TASKS.md** to see current milestone, pending tasks, and priorities  
3. **Review this file** for project-specific guidance and context
4. **Mark completed tasks** in TASKS.md immediately upon completion
5. **Add newly discovered tasks** to TASKS.md when found during development

## üíª Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production  
pnpm build

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Complete setup (first time)
./supabase/scripts/setup_enhanced_training.sh

# Seed test data
./supabase/scripts/seed_database.sh

# Backup before changes (ALWAYS run before schema changes)
./supabase/scripts/backup_user_data.sh

# Reset database (development only)
./supabase/scripts/reset_database.sh
```

### Supabase CLI Best Practices (2025)
```bash
# Run SQL queries directly (preferred for automation)
supabase db query "SELECT * FROM better_auth_users LIMIT 5;"

# Execute SQL files (for complex operations)
supabase db query --file ./supabase/migrations/001_setup.sql

# Database operations with explicit environment
supabase db reset --linked
supabase db push --linked

# Local development
supabase start
supabase db seed
```

## üîß Important Development Guidelines

### Authentication (CRITICAL - PRODUCTION READY)
- **Better Auth**: Successfully migrated from NextAuth.js to Better Auth for improved stability
- **Direct ID Usage**: Database uses Better Auth IDs directly - no more user mapping system
- **Testing**: All existing test credentials work seamlessly with the modernized system
- **Sessions**: Better Auth provides superior session management and security

### State Management (CRITICAL)
- **NO React Context** for global state - use Jotai atoms only
- **NO useState** for shared state - use Jotai atoms
- **Pattern**: Create hooks that use Jotai atoms (see `useNotifications`, `useWorkouts`)
- **Derived State**: Use derived atoms for computed/filtered data
- **File**: All atoms live in `src/lib/atoms.ts`

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, full type coverage required
- **ESLint**: Next.js config with additional rules
- **Imports**: Use `@/` path aliases for clean imports
- **Structured Logging**: Use tslog with `createLogger('context')` - no console.log statements
- **UI Components**: Use HeroUI components with Mountain Peak Enhanced design system

### Structured Logging (CRITICAL)
- **Logger Creation**: `const logger = createLogger('contextName')` in each file
- **Log Levels**: debug (development), info (important events), warn (warnings), error (exceptions)
- **No Console Statements**: All console.log/error replaced with structured logging
- **Context Names**: Use descriptive context names (e.g., 'useTrainingPlans', 'middleware', 'better-auth-client')

### Security (CRITICAL)
- **No credentials in code**: Use environment variables for ALL database connections
- **Environment Variables**: Required variables in .env.local (DATABASE_PASSWORD, DB_USER, etc.)
- **Secure Scripts**: All database scripts use `source load_env.sh` for secure environment loading
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Use parameterized queries and input validation in all database operations
- **Test data only**: Test credentials excluded from git
- **RLS policies**: Database access controlled by user roles
- **API Key Migration**: Upgraded to new Supabase API keys (sb_publishable_ and sb_secret_)
- **Security Incident**: Resolved GitHub security alert for leaked service key (July 15, 2025)

### Database Script Security Guidelines
- **NEVER hardcode database URLs** - Use environment variables only
- **Use load_env.sh**: All scripts must `source "$SCRIPT_DIR/load_env.sh"`
- **Validate inputs**: Check table names match regex `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`
- **Use quoted identifiers**: Wrap table names in quotes for SQL queries
- **Parameterized queries**: Use `psql -c "query" param1 param2` format when possible
- **Prefer Supabase CLI**: Use `supabase db query` over direct `psql` for consistency and authentication

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Guidelines
- **Context7 MCP**: Use for up-to-date documentation access (`use context7` in prompts)
- **GitHub MCP**: For repository operations and issue management
- **Security**: Only use trusted MCP servers, review configurations
- **Configuration**: Store in project `.mcp.json` for team consistency
