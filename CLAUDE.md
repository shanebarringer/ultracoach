# CLAUDE.md - UltraCoach Project Guide

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the UltraCoach project. It ensures consistency, context, and proper workflow across all development sessions.

## üîÑ Session Workflow (IMPORTANT)

**At the start of EVERY new conversation:**

1. **Read PLANNING.md** to understand project vision, architecture, and technical context
2. **Check TASKS.md** to see current milestone, pending tasks, and priorities
3. **Review this file** for project-specific guidance and context
4. **Mark completed tasks** in TASKS.md immediately upon completion. After commits, move complete tasks to `COMPLETED_TASKS.md`
5. **Add newly discovered tasks** to TASKS.md when found during development

### MCP Instructions

- When fetching data from Context7 MCP - add to the `.context7-docs` directory (gitignored). Create a new directory for the library if one does not exist. Before fetching from Context7 refer to `.context7-docs` to see if data and/or snippets have already been added

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Connection (IMPORTANT)

**Always use the proper database scripts - NEVER try to connect directly as local user!**

### Correct Database Commands:

```bash
# Connect to database
pnpm db:connect

# Run a query
pnpm db:query "SELECT * FROM coach_runners LIMIT 5;"

# Drizzle operations
pnpm db:generate    # Generate migrations
pnpm db:push        # Push schema changes (uses --force)
pnpm db:migrate     # Apply migrations
pnpm db:studio      # Open Drizzle Studio

# Database seeding and setup
pnpm db:seed        # Seed database with test data
pnpm db:fresh       # Reset and seed database
```

### Database Philosophy:

- **Use Drizzle for ALL database operations** (migrations, queries, schema changes)
- Environment variables are properly loaded from `.env.local`
- Scripts handle Supabase connection string correctly
- NEVER use direct psql commands without proper environment loading

## üìä Project Overview

UltraCoach is a professional ultramarathon coaching platform built with Next.js 15, Supabase, BetterAuth, and Jotai state management. The platform supports race-centric training plans, proper periodization, coach-runner relationships, and real-time communication.

- **Coach-Runner Relationship System**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Comprehensive bidirectional relationship system with API layer and UI components
- **Latest Achievement**: Complete coach-runner relationship foundation with database migration, API endpoints, and management UI
- **Current Focus**: Dashboard integration fixes, fresh data seeding, and invitation system implementation
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, Better Auth, Drizzle ORM, HeroUI, Jotai state management with coach-runner relationship architecture

## üö® TypeScript Code Quality Standards (CRITICAL)

**NEVER use `any` type - this is strictly forbidden**

Instead, always:

1. Define proper types and interfaces for all data structures
2. Use specific union types (e.g., `'runner' | 'coach'`) instead of string
3. Use `unknown` for truly unknown data, then type guard/validate it
4. Create reusable type definitions at the top of test files
5. Prefer type safety over convenience - proper types prevent bugs

Example of CORRECT typing:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Define proper types
type UserRole = 'runner' | 'coach'
type SessionUser = { id: string; email: string; role?: UserRole }
type SessionData = { user?: SessionUser }

// ‚úÖ GOOD - Use proper types
const userRole: UserRole = sessionData?.user?.role || 'runner'
```

Example of INCORRECT typing:

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD - Never use any
const sessionData: any = { user: { role: 'coach' } }
const userRole = (sessionData.user as any).role || 'runner'
```
