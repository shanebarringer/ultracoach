# CLAUDE.md - UltraCoach Project Guide

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the UltraCoach project. It ensures consistency, context, and proper workflow across all development sessions.

## üîÑ Session Workflow (IMPORTANT)

**At the start of EVERY new conversation:**
1. **Read PLANNING.md** to understand project vision, architecture, and technical context
2. **Check TASKS.md** to see current milestone, pending tasks, and priorities  
3. **Review this file** for project-specific guidance and context
4. **Mark completed tasks** in TASKS.md immediately upon completion
5. **Add newly discovered tasks** to TASKS.md when found during development

## üìä Project Overview

UltraCoach is a professional ultramarathon coaching platform built with Next.js 15, Supabase, and Jotai state management. The platform supports race-centric training plans, proper periodization, coach-runner relationships, and real-time communication.

### ‚úÖ Completed Session: Better Auth Integration & Hybrid Authentication System (COMPLETE)

**Authentication System - ‚úÖ COMPLETED:**
- ‚úÖ **Role-Based Routing**: Fixed coach/runner dashboard routing with proper role detection
- ‚úÖ **User Role API**: Created `/api/user/role` endpoint for fetching user roles from database
- ‚úÖ **Homepage Redirection**: Authenticated users automatically redirect to appropriate dashboards
- ‚úÖ **Session Management**: Fixed Better Auth session handling and token validation
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Resolved empty error objects and improved client-side error management

**Hybrid Authentication System - ‚úÖ COMPLETED:**
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced User Mapping**: Bidirectional mapping with caching for Better Auth ‚Üî UUID conversion
- ‚úÖ **ID Format Detection**: Utility functions to detect Better Auth IDs vs UUIDs automatically
- ‚úÖ **API Compatibility**: Seamless operation with both ID formats across all endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Decision**: Hybrid approach chosen as optimal solution for stability and performance
- ‚úÖ **Caching System**: In-memory caching for user ID mappings to optimize performance
- ‚úÖ **Flexible Resolution**: Smart `resolveUserId` function for automatic format handling

**UX Improvements - ‚úÖ COMPLETED:**
- ‚úÖ **Homepage Logic**: Logged-in users skip landing page and go directly to dashboards
- ‚úÖ **Role Detection**: Proper coach vs runner role detection and routing
- ‚úÖ **Session Persistence**: Fixed hydration issues and session restoration
- ‚úÖ **Error Reduction**: Eliminated authentication console errors and improved stability
- ‚úÖ **Seamless Operation**: Users experience optimal performance with hybrid architecture

**Integration Status: 100% Complete - Hybrid authentication system fully functional! üéâ**

**Key Benefits Achieved:**
- Seamless user experience with proper role-based routing
- Eliminated UUID format conflicts through elegant hybrid architecture
- Improved homepage UX following web app best practices
- Stable authentication with robust error handling
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Optimal solution combining Better Auth benefits with database stability
- **Performance Optimizations**: Caching and smart ID resolution for fast operations
- **Production Ready**: Proven architecture ready for production deployment

## üíª Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production  
pnpm build

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Complete setup (first time)
./supabase/scripts/setup_enhanced_training.sh

# Seed test data
./supabase/scripts/seed_database.sh

# Backup before changes (ALWAYS run before schema changes)
./supabase/scripts/backup_user_data.sh

# Reset database (development only)
./supabase/scripts/reset_database.sh
```

## üéØ Key Features & Context

### Enhanced Training System (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
- **5 new tables**: races, training_phases, plan_phases, plan_templates, template_phases
- **Enhanced existing tables**: training_plans and workouts with race targeting
- **15+ training templates**: 50K to 100M for all skill levels
- **20+ real races**: Western States, Leadville, UTMB, etc.
- **Plan sequencing**: 50K ‚Üí 50M ‚Üí 50K ‚Üí 100M progression support

### Better Auth Integration (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
- **Integration Status**: Hybrid authentication system fully operational and production-ready
- **Security**: Migrated to new Supabase API keys (sb_publishable_ and sb_secret_)
- **Architecture**: Hybrid approach with Better Auth + user mapping system for optimal performance
- **API Routes**: All routes working seamlessly with Better Auth authentication
- **Benefits**: Better TypeScript support, improved session management, zero-downtime deployment

### Test Data System (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
- **Test Users**: 2 coaches, 10 runners with realistic relationships and fixed IDs
- **Credentials**: All test accounts use password `password123`
- **Access**: `supabase/temp/credentials/test_users_2025_07_15.txt` for login details
- **Consistent Testing**: Fixed UUIDs prevent messaging errors and enable reliable testing

## üîß Important Development Guidelines

### Authentication (CRITICAL - HYBRID ARCHITECTURE)
- **Better Auth**: Successfully migrated from NextAuth.js to Better Auth for improved stability
- **Hybrid System**: Better Auth handles authentication, user mapping handles database compatibility
- **Testing**: All existing test credentials work seamlessly with the hybrid system
- **Sessions**: Better Auth provides superior session management and security

### State Management (CRITICAL)
- **NO React Context** for global state - use Jotai atoms only
- **NO useState** for shared state - use Jotai atoms
- **Pattern**: Create hooks that use Jotai atoms (see `useNotifications`, `useWorkouts`)
- **Derived State**: Use derived atoms for computed/filtered data
- **File**: All atoms live in `src/lib/atoms.ts`

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, full type coverage required
- **ESLint**: Next.js config with additional rules
- **Imports**: Use `@/` path aliases for clean imports
- **No console.log**: Use `tslog` for structured logging
- **UI Components**: Use HeroUI components with Mountain Peak Enhanced design system

### Security
- **No credentials in code**: Use environment variables
- **Test data only**: Test credentials excluded from git
- **RLS policies**: Database access controlled by user roles
- **API Key Migration**: Upgraded to new Supabase API keys (sb_publishable_ and sb_secret_)
- **Security Incident**: Resolved GitHub security alert for leaked service key (July 15, 2025)
