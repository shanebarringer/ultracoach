# CLAUDE.md - UltraCoach Project Guide

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the UltraCoach project. It ensures consistency, context, and proper workflow across all development sessions.

## üîÑ Session Workflow (IMPORTANT)

**At the start of EVERY new conversation:**

1. **Read PLANNING.md** to understand project vision, architecture, and technical context
2. **Check TASKS.md** to see current milestone, pending tasks, and priorities
3. **Review this file** for project-specific guidance and context
4. **Mark completed tasks** in TASKS.md immediately upon completion
5. **Add newly discovered tasks** to TASKS.md when found during development

## üìä Project Overview

UltraCoach is a professional ultramarathon coaching platform built with Next.js 15, Supabase, and Jotai state management. The platform supports race-centric training plans, proper periodization, coach-runner relationships, and real-time communication.
