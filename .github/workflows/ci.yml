# CI Workflow for UltraCoach
#
# ⚠️  SETUP REQUIRED: GitHub Repository Secrets
#
# You MUST set this secret before CI will work:
#
# 1. BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (required for authentication)
#    Generate: openssl rand -hex 32
#    Location: GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions → New repository secret
#
# The workflow creates a test PostgreSQL database automatically via Docker
# and seeds it with test users through Better Auth API calls.
#
# CI Architecture:
# ├── PostgreSQL service container (postgres:15)
# ├── Database schema from supabase/migrations/*.sql
# ├── Next.js app (built and started on port 3001)
# ├── Test user creation via Better Auth API
# ├── Playwright MCP integration for enhanced browser automation
# └── Playwright E2E tests (with screenshots/videos on failure)
#
# MCP Features:
# ├── Advanced network interception and API testing
# ├── Visual comparison testing for UI regression detection
# ├── Performance metrics collection and analysis
# ├── Sharded test execution with intelligent load balancing
# └── Enhanced debugging and reporting capabilities

          - **Parallel Workers**: 3 per shard
          - **Test Distribution**: Optimized for database safety

          ## Key Metrics
          - **Authentication Tests**: Core functionality validated
          - **Dashboard Tests**: User experience verified  
          - **Performance**: Enhanced with parallelization

          ## MCP Features Utilized
          - ✅ Network interception for API testing
          - ✅ Visual comparisons for UI regression detection
          - ✅ Performance metrics collection
          - ✅ Sharded reporting and analysis
