| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| TrainingPeaks  | Training plans       | Too cycling-focused, expensive |
| Strava         | Activity monitoring  | Not a coaching platform        |
| WhatsApp/Slack | Communication        | Fragmented, no context         |
| Google Sheets  | Custom periodization | Manual, error-prone            |

#### Pain Points

> "I use 4-5 different tools that don't talk to each other. Every morning I'm logging into TrainingPeaks, checking Strava, responding to WhatsApp messages, and updating my spreadsheet. It's exhausting."

> "TrainingPeaks was built for cyclists and triathletes. The periodization doesn't fit how I coach ultras, and the TSS metrics don't translate well to trail running."

> "I spend more time on admin than actual coaching. I didn't get into this to manage software—I want to help athletes achieve their goals."

> "My athletes struggle to understand the complex analytics. They just want to know if they're on track for their goal race."

> "There's no platform built for how I actually coach ultras. Everything is adapted, never native."

#### Feature Priorities

1. Race-centric plan building with periodization
2. Simple, integrated athlete communication
3. Strava/Garmin sync for automatic activity import
4. Easy-to-use interface for athletes
5. Reasonable pricing that supports business growth

#### Willingness to Pay

- **Platform:** $30-60/month
- **Would pay more for:** Time-saving features, white-label branding
- **Highly sensitive to:** Per-athlete fees that eat into margins
