Subject: Request for Athlete Connection Limit Increase - App ID 157317

Hello Strava Developer Support,

I am developing UltraCoach, a professional ultramarathon coaching platform that integrates with Strava for activity synchronization.

App Details:
- App ID: 157317
- App Name: UltraCoach
- Current Limit: 1 connected athlete
- Currently Connected: 0 athletes
- Issue: Getting "403 Limit exceeded" despite 0/1 usage

Request:
Could you please increase the athlete connection limit to at least 50-100 for development and testing purposes?

Use Case:
- Development testing with multiple user roles (coaches and runners)
- Beta testing with real users before production launch
- The platform helps coaches manage ultramarathon training by syncing Strava activities

The app is legitimate and will help coaches better serve ultramarathon athletes through automated activity synchronization.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Shane Barringer
UltraCoach Developer
