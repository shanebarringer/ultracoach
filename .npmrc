# IMPORTANT: Despite the "Ignored build scripts" warning from pnpm v10+,
# all scripts ARE running correctly (verified by testing native modules).
# This is an informational security warning from pnpm, not a functional issue.

# Approved packages for build scripts (documented for security audit):
# - bcrypt: Password hashing with native bindings (REQUIRED)
# - better-sqlite3: Better Auth database with native bindings (REQUIRED)
# - @sentry/cli: Error tracking and monitoring (REQUIRED)
# - esbuild: Build tooling for Next.js and dependencies (REQUIRED)
# - sharp: Image optimization for Next.js (REQUIRED)
# - @heroui/shared-utils: HeroUI component library utilities (REQUIRED)
# - @prisma/client, @prisma/engines, prisma: Transitive dependencies (safe)
# - unrs-resolver: Build tooling dependency (safe)
#
# The warning message can be safely ignored as all scripts are approved and functional.
# Future pnpm versions may provide better configuration for suppressing this warning.
