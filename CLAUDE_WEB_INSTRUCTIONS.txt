TASK: Verify workout persistence fixes in UltraCoach preview deployment

CONTEXT:
Branch fix/workout-persistence-suspense has been merged with comprehensive fixes for ULT-82
(workouts not loading in production). Read VERIFICATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md for complete details.

CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:
Added server-side check to asyncWorkoutsAtom to prevent SSR API calls that fail silently.
The atom now returns empty array during SSR and hydrates with actual data on client-side.

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
- asyncWorkoutsAtom was trying to fetch data during server-side rendering (SSR)
- axios interceptor explicitly returns false for server-side requests (no window object)
- This caused API calls to fail silently, resulting in empty workouts array
- On page refresh, component would render with empty data before client hydration completed

SOLUTION:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken):
export const asyncWorkoutsAtom = atom(async get => {
  get(workoutsRefreshTriggerAtom)
  const { api } = await import('@/lib/api-client')
  const response = await api.get('/api/workouts') // ❌ Fails on server
})

// AFTER (Fixed):
export const asyncWorkoutsAtom = atom(async get => {
  get(workoutsRefreshTriggerAtom)

  // CRITICAL: Only run on client side
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
    return []
  }

  const { api } = await import('@/lib/api-client')
  const response = await api.get('/api/workouts') // ✅ Only runs on client
})
```

CRITICAL TESTS TO RUN:

1. Get Preview URL from Vercel/GitHub PR
2. Sign in as test runner (alex.rivera@ultracoach.dev / SecurePass123!)
3. Navigate to /workouts page
4. Create 2-3 test workouts
5. ⚠️ Hard refresh page (Cmd+R) - CRITICAL: Verify workouts persist and show on first load
6. Navigate to /weekly-planner
7. ⚠️ Hard refresh weekly planner - CRITICAL: Verify workouts persist

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Workouts load on initial visit (even if they already exist in database)
✅ Workouts persist after page refresh (not empty)
✅ Workouts show up on FIRST LOAD when they already exist
✅ No "Failed to parse URL" errors in console
✅ Console shows: "Workouts fetched successfully { count: X }"
✅ Network tab shows successful /api/workouts requests (200 status)

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- DevTools Console: Check for fetch logs and errors
- Network Tab: Verify /api/workouts returns 200 with data
- Application Tab: Verify session cookies are set
- First Paint: Workouts should appear on first load, not just after refresh

SYMPTOMS THAT SHOULD BE FIXED:
❌ Workouts disappear after refresh
❌ Empty workout list on first page load (when workouts exist in DB)
❌ "No workouts found" message when workouts should be there
❌ Console showing { count: 0 } when workouts exist

IF TESTS FAIL:
Use failure scenario templates in VERIFICATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md to report:
- Exact failure symptoms
- Console errors (copy full stack)
- Network request details (status, headers, response)
- Screenshots if possible

FILES CHANGED IN THIS FIX:
- src/lib/atoms/workouts.ts (added typeof window check on line 34)

TECHNICAL CONTEXT:
Fixed server-side rendering issue where asyncWorkoutsAtom tried to make API calls
during SSR. The axios interceptor's isSameOriginApiRequest function returns false
on the server (no window object), causing credentials to not be attached and
requests to fail silently. Now atom returns empty array during SSR and properly
fetches data when component mounts on client-side.

START HERE: Read VERIFICATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md first, then run all tests systematically.

KEY DIFFERENCE FROM PREVIOUS ATTEMPT:
Previous fix focused on hydration timing and axios integration, but missed that
the async atom was attempting to run on the server during SSR. This fix ensures
the atom only fetches data on the client-side where cookies are available.
