- [x] **Create mobile navigation content** - Built `MobileNavContent.tsx` component handling all navigation links with proper authentication state
- [x] **Update header integration** - Modified `Header.tsx` to use HeroUI NavbarMenuToggle with drawer state management
- [x] **Add drawer state to UI atoms** - Extended `uiStateAtom` with `isDrawerOpen: false` for proper state management
- [x] **Install HeroUI drawer dependency** - Added `@heroui/drawer` package to support new navigation system
- [x] **Update layout integration** - Modified `Layout.tsx` to include `AppDrawer` component throughout the application

### Server/Client Architecture Validation

- [x] **Audit all authenticated routes** - Comprehensive review revealed all routes already properly implemented with Server/Client hybrid pattern
- [x] **Verify dynamic rendering** - Build analysis confirmed all authenticated routes show "ƒ (Server)" indicating proper dynamic rendering
- [x] **Validate server-side authentication** - All routes use `requireAuth()`, `requireCoach()`, or `requireRunner()` functions with proper session handling
- [x] **Check force-dynamic exports** - All authenticated pages properly export `const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- [x] **Test production build** - Build analysis shows zero static routes in authenticated areas, preventing personalization issues

### Technical Achievements

- **Mobile-First Design**: Eliminated desktop sidebar in favor of responsive HeroUI drawer system for consistent cross-platform experience
- **Architecture Compliance**: Validated that all authenticated routes already follow the required Server/Client hybrid pattern from CLAUDE.md requirements
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Confirmed all personalized routes properly force dynamic rendering, preventing static generation issues
- **State Management**: Proper integration of drawer state with existing Jotai UI state atoms
- **Component Organization**: Clean separation between server authentication logic and client-side interactive components
- **Production Ready**: Build validation confirms proper route rendering types and zero architecture violations

**Impact**: This completion validates that the critical Server/Client architecture requirements from CLAUDE.md are already properly implemented, while modernizing the navigation system with a mobile-first HeroUI drawer approach for improved user experience.
