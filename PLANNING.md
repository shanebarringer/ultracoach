# UltraCoach - Project Planning & Architecture

## üéØ Vision

Transform UltraCoach into a professional ultramarathon coaching platform that supports proper periodization, race-centric training plans, and seamless coach-runner relationships. The platform enables coaches to create sophisticated training programs while providing runners with clear guidance, progress tracking, and real-time communication.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router
- **Rendering**: Server/Client Component hybrid pattern for authenticated routes (forces dynamic rendering)
- **Design System**: Mountain Peak Enhanced - Alpine aesthetic with professional UX patterns
- **UI Library**: HeroUI with custom Mountain Peak theme
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 with HeroUI theme integration + Custom alpine color palette
- **State Management**: Jotai for atomic, granular state management
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with Drizzle adapter, custom session management, and role-based access
- **HTTP Client**: Native fetch with `credentials: 'same-origin'` for all internal APIs, future migration to axios planned
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime for live updates
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript with strict mode for type safety

#### Server/Client Component Architecture (CRITICAL)

**Problem Solved**: Routes like `/chat` were being marked as "static" causing personalized content issues and production deployment problems.

**Solution**: Hybrid architecture pattern:

```typescript
// Server Component (page.tsx) - Forces dynamic rendering
export default async function AuthPage() {
  await headers()                           // Forces dynamic rendering
  const session = await getServerSession() // Server-side authentication
  if (!session) redirect('/auth/signin')   // Server-side redirects
  return <AuthClient user={session.user} />
}

// Client Component (*Client.tsx) - Handles interactivity
'use client'
export default function AuthClient({ user }) {
  // Client-side state management with Jotai
  // Interactive features and real-time updates
}
```

**Benefits**:

- ‚úÖ Proper dynamic rendering for personalized content
- ‚úÖ Server-side authentication and redirects
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior between development and production
- ‚úÖ Optimal performance with hybrid static/dynamic approach

### Backend Architecture

- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with custom fields (role, userType, fullName), customSession plugin, and proper TypeScript inference
- **API**: Next.js API routes with RESTful design
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (future: workout photos, documents)

### Database Schema

- **better_auth_sessions**: User sessions with correct schema (id AND token fields)
- **better_auth_accounts**: OAuth accounts for social authentication
- **better_auth_verification_tokens**: Email verification and password reset tokens
- **training_plans**: Enhanced with race targeting and phase tracking
- **workouts**: Enhanced with categorization and intensity tracking
- **conversations/messages**: Real-time chat system

}
```

### Package Manager

- **Primary**: pnpm (better performance, disk efficiency, stricter dependency management)
- **Commands**: `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Tools

### Development Environment

- **Node.js**: v18+ (recommended v20+)
- **pnpm**: Latest version for package management
- **Git**: Version control with GitHub integration
- **VS Code**: Recommended IDE with TypeScript/React extensions

### Database & Infrastructure

- **Supabase CLI**: For database management and migrations
  ```bash
  npm install -g supabase
  supabase login --token YOUR_TOKEN
  supabase link --project-ref ccnbzjpccmlribljugve
  ```
- **PostgreSQL**: Local development (optional, Supabase provides hosted)
- **GitHub CLI**: For PR management
  ```bash
  brew install gh
  gh auth login
  ```

### Database Management Scripts

- **TypeScript Seeding**: `pnpm db:seed` or `pnpm prod:db:seed` - Production-ready seeding with Better Auth integration
- **Setup**: `./supabase/scripts/setup_enhanced_training.sh` - Initial database setup
- **Reset**: `./supabase/scripts/reset_database.sh` - Development database reset
- **Backup**: `./supabase/scripts/backup_user_data.sh` - User data backup utility

### Better Auth Schema Requirements (CRITICAL)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Better Auth has specific schema requirements that must be followed exactly:

- **Session Table**: Must have BOTH `id` field (primary key) AND separate `token` field (unique)
- **Schema Generation**: Always use `npx @better-auth/cli generate` to create correct schemas
- **Manual Schema**: If creating manually, ensure session table has both `id` AND `token` columns
- **Validation**: Run schema validation before deploying to prevent "hex string expected" errors
- **Credential Accounts**: Users need proper `provider_id: 'credential'` records for password authentication

### Supabase CLI Operations (Modern Approach)

```bash
# Direct SQL execution (preferred for 2025+)
supabase db query "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables;"

# File-based operations
supabase db query --file ./path/to/script.sql

# Environment-specific operations
supabase db reset --linked    # Production database
supabase db reset --local     # Local development

# Migration management
supabase db push              # Apply migrations
supabase db pull              # Sync schema changes
```

## üîß Recent Authentication Fixes (2025-08-03)

### Critical Issues Resolved

1. **Routing Loop Bug (FIXED)** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: Infinite redirect loop between `/dashboard/runner` and `/dashboard/coach`
   - **Root Cause**: Circular redirect logic when user role didn't match expected route
   - **Solution**: Created unified `DashboardRouter` component with proper state handling
   - **Files**: `src/components/dashboard/DashboardRouter.tsx`, updated dashboard pages

2. **Better Auth Role Integration (FIXED)** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: User roles stored as `'user'` instead of `'coach'/'runner'`
   - **Root Cause**: Manual database insertion bypassing Better Auth validation
   - **Solution**: Added `customSession` plugin and `customSessionClient` for proper type inference
   - **Files**: `src/lib/better-auth.ts`, `src/lib/better-auth-client.ts`

3. **Database Schema Standardization (IMPROVED)** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent field naming and role values
   - **Solution**: Updated existing user roles and created Better Auth-compliant seeding script
   - **Files**: `scripts/seed-users-better-auth.ts`, database role updates

### Better Auth Integration Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Use Better Auth sign-up API instead of manual user insertion
- ‚úÖ Configure `customSession` plugin for proper session data transformation
- ‚úÖ Add `customSessionClient` for client-side type inference
- ‚úÖ Implement unified dashboard routing to prevent circular redirects
- ‚úÖ Store Better Auth documentation in `.context7-docs/better-auth/`

### New Seeding Approach

```bash
# Use Better Auth-compliant seeding (recommended)
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users-better-auth.ts

# Old manual seeding (deprecated)
pnpm run db:seed
```

## üöÄ Development Commands

4. **Deployment Automation**: Use GitHub MCP for CI/CD pipeline management

### Security Considerations for MCP

- Only use trusted, verified MCP servers
- Store MCP configurations in version control for team consistency
- Regularly audit MCP server permissions and access patterns
- Monitor for prompt injection or data leakage in MCP interactions

This planning document serves as the foundation for all development decisions and architectural choices in the UltraCoach project.
