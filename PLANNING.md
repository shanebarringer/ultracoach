## 🎯 Vision

Transform UltraCoach into a professional ultramarathon coaching platform that supports proper periodization, race-centric training plans, and seamless coach-runner relationships. The platform enables coaches to create sophisticated training programs while providing runners with clear guidance, progress tracking, and real-time communication.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router
- **Rendering**: Server/Client Component hybrid pattern for authenticated routes (forces dynamic rendering)
- **Design System**: Mountain Peak Enhanced - Alpine aesthetic with professional UX patterns
- **UI Library**: HeroUI with custom Mountain Peak theme
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 with HeroUI theme integration + Custom alpine color palette

#### Server/Client Component Architecture (CRITICAL)

**Problem Solved**: Routes like `/chat` were being marked as "static" causing personalized content issues and production deployment problems.

**Solution**: Hybrid architecture pattern:

```typescript
// Server Component (page.tsx) - Forces dynamic rendering
export default async function AuthPage() {
  await headers()                           // Forces dynamic rendering
  const session = await getServerSession() // Server-side authentication
  if (!session) redirect('/auth/signin')   // Server-side redirects
  return <AuthClient user={session.user} />
}

// Client Component (*Client.tsx) - Handles interactivity
'use client'
export default function AuthClient({ user }) {
  // Client-side state management with Jotai
  // Interactive features and real-time updates
}
```

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Proper dynamic rendering for personalized content

## 🛠️ Required Tools

### Development Environment

- **Node.js**: v18+ (recommended v20+)
- **pnpm**: Latest version for package management
- **Git**: Version control with GitHub integration
- **VS Code**: Recommended IDE with TypeScript/React extensions

### Database & Infrastructure

- **Supabase CLI**: For database management and migrations
  ```bash
  npm install -g supabase
  supabase login --token YOUR_TOKEN
  supabase link --project-ref ccnbzjpccmlribljugve
  ```
- **PostgreSQL**: Local development (optional, Supabase provides hosted)
- **GitHub CLI**: For PR management
  ```bash
  brew install gh
  gh auth login
  ```

### Database Management Scripts

- **TypeScript Seeding**: `pnpm db:seed` or `pnpm prod:db:seed` - Production-ready seeding with Better Auth integration
- **Setup**: `./supabase/scripts/setup_enhanced_training.sh` - Initial database setup
- **Reset**: `./supabase/scripts/reset_database.sh` - Development database reset
- **Backup**: `./supabase/scripts/backup_user_data.sh` - User data backup utility

### Better Auth Schema Requirements (CRITICAL)

⚠️ **Important**: Better Auth has specific schema requirements that must be followed exactly:

- **Session Table**: Must have BOTH `id` field (primary key) AND separate `token` field (unique)
- **Schema Generation**: Always use `npx @better-auth/cli generate` to create correct schemas
- **Manual Schema**: If creating manually, ensure session table has both `id` AND `token` columns
- **Validation**: Run schema validation before deploying to prevent "hex string expected" errors
- **Credential Accounts**: Users need proper `provider_id: 'credential'` records for password authentication

### Supabase CLI Operations (Modern Approach)

```bash
# Direct SQL execution (preferred for 2025+)
supabase db query "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables;"

# File-based operations
supabase db query --file ./path/to/script.sql

# Environment-specific operations
supabase db reset --linked    # Production database
supabase db reset --local     # Local development

# Migration management
supabase db push              # Apply migrations
supabase db pull              # Sync schema changes
```
