## ‚úÖ **Authentication & Routing Fixes Milestone (COMPLETED 2025-08-03)**

### Critical Issues Resolved

- [x] **Routing Loop Bug** - Fixed infinite redirect between runner/coach dashboards
  - Created unified `DashboardRouter` component with proper state management
  - Eliminated circular redirect logic that caused server crashes
  - Added graceful handling of invalid/missing user roles

- [x] **Better Auth Integration** - Fixed user role field mapping and session management
  - Added `customSession` plugin for proper role handling
  - Configured `customSessionClient` for TypeScript inference
  - Updated existing user roles from `'user'` to proper `'coach'/'runner'` values

  - Created `scripts/seed-users-better-auth.ts` using proper Better Auth flow
  - Automated `.env.local` credential updates during seeding
  - Stored Better Auth best practices in `.context7-docs/better-auth/`

### Files Modified

### Testing Results

‚úÖ **No more routing loops** - Users can login and stay on appropriate dashboard  
‚úÖ **Proper role-based access** - Coaches see coach features, runners see runner features  
‚úÖ **Better Auth best practices** - Following official patterns for stability  
‚úÖ **Reliable seeding** - Consistent test user creation with proper roles
